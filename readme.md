PDF Parser:
A simple web application built with Python and Flask that parses USB Power Delivery (PD) specification PDFs. It allows a user to upload a PDF, which is then processed to extract its structured content (based on the table of contents) into a downloadable JSON file.

Features:
Web-Based File Upload: An easy-to-use web interface for uploading PDF files.

Table of Contents Parsing: Intelligently identifies and parses the document's table of contents to understand its structure.

Section Content Extraction: Extracts the full text content for each section identified in the TOC.

JSON Output: Generates a clean, well-formatted, and human-readable JSON file as the final output for download.

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
If you do not have a requirements.txt file, create one and add the following lines to it:
Flask
PyMuPDF
pdfplumber


How to Use the Application:
Run the Flask Server
With your terminal active in the project directory, run the main application script.

Bash

python app.py
Open in Browser
The terminal will show a message that the server is running, typically on http://127.0.0.1:5000. Copy this URL and paste it into your web browser.
